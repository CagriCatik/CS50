# 1 Demonstrates addition

x = 1
y = 2

z = x + y

print(z)


# 2 Demonstrates (unintended) concatenation of strings

# Prompt user for two integers
x = input("What's x? ")
y = input("What's y? ")

# Print sum
z = x + y
print(z)


# 3 Demonstrates conversion from str to int

x = input("What's x? ")
y = input("What's y? ")

z = int(x) + int(y)

print(z)

# 4 Demonstrates conversion of str to float

x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))

z = x + y

print(z)


# 5 Demonstrates rounding to nearest int

x = float(input("What's x? "))
y = float(input("What's y? "))

z = round(x + y)

print(z)
